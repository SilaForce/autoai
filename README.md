# AutoAI

An Android app for car owners to track vehicles, costs, reminders, and chat with an AI assistant about their car. Built as a portfolio project exploring modern Android development end to end — Jetpack Compose, Clean Architecture, MVI, Firebase, and the Gemini API.

## What it does

- **Garage** — add multiple vehicles with make, model, year, fuel type, mileage, plate, and an optional photo. Mark one as active.
- **Home** — at-a-glance view of the active vehicle, monthly expense total, and the next upcoming reminder.
- **Costs** — log fuel, service, and other expenses, broken down by category with statistics over time.
- **Reminders** — schedule maintenance tasks (oil change, inspection, registration) with notifications.
- **AI Chat** — ask Gemini about your specific car: troubleshooting, when to service something, what a warning light means. Supports image attachments (e.g. snap a dashboard light).
- **Profile** — edit name, avatar, currency preference; delete account.

## Tech stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | Kotlin |
| UI | Jetpack Compose, Material 3 |
| Architecture | Clean Architecture + MVI |
| DI | Koin |
| Async | Coroutines + Flow |
| Navigation | Compose Navigation (type-safe routes with `@Serializable`) |
| Networking | Ktor (for the NHTSA make/model autocomplete) |
| Backend | Firebase Auth, Firestore, Cloud Storage |
| AI | Google Gen AI SDK (Gemini) |
| Image loading | Coil |
| Serialization | KotlinX Serialization |
| Testing | JUnit, Turbine, AssertK |

## Architecture

Strict layering, feature-first modularization:

```
:app                          ← entry point, Koin wiring, nav setup
:core:domain (folded into :domain in this repo)
:domain                       ← models, repository interfaces, use cases, Result type
:data                         ← Firebase implementations, DTOs, mappers
```

- **`domain`** has zero framework dependencies. All errors are typed via a `Result<T, DataError>` wrapper; raw exceptions are caught and mapped in the data layer.
- **`data`** owns Firebase access. Each Firestore call goes through a `safeFirebaseCall` wrapper that maps `FirebaseFirestoreException` codes to typed `DataError`s.
- **`app`** holds presentation (ViewModels, screens, MVI state/actions/events). Every screen is split into a Smart `Screen` composable (connects to the VM) and a Dumb `Content` composable (pure UI, previewable).

Detailed conventions live in `CLAUDE.md` and the `.claude/skills/` directory — those are the playbooks for adding new features, modules, ViewModels, and so on.

## Running locally

You need:
- Android Studio Ladybug or newer
- JDK 11+
- A Firebase project (the app expects Firestore + Auth + Storage enabled)
- A Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### 1. Clone and open

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SilaForce/autoai.git
cd AutoAI
```

### 2. Add your Firebase config

Create a Firebase Android app for the package `com.example.autoai`, then download the `google-services.json` and place it at:

```
app/google-services.json
```

This file is gitignored — keep it that way.

### 3. Add your Gemini API key

Create `local.properties` at the repo root (or edit the existing one) and add:

```properties
sdk.dir=/path/to/your/Android/sdk
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
```

The key is read at build time and exposed via `BuildConfig.GEMINI_API_KEY`. `local.properties` is gitignored.

### 4. Deploy Firestore indexes (one-time)

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

This pushes the composite indexes in `firestore.indexes.json` (vehicles by `userId + make + model`, costs by `vehicleId + dateMillis`).

### 5. Build and run

```bash
./gradlew :app:installDebug
```

Or just hit Run in Android Studio with a device or emulator attached.

## Project structure

```
app/                  Presentation layer — ViewModels, screens, components, navigation
domain/               Pure Kotlin — models, use cases, repository interfaces
data/                 Firebase + Ktor implementations, DTOs, mappers
build-logic/          (none yet — convention plugins live inline in build files)
firestore.indexes.json    Firestore composite index definitions
```

Inside `app/src/main/java/com/example/autoai/presentation/features/` each feature is its own folder containing `*Screen`, `*Content`, `*ViewModel`, `*State`, `*Event`, `*SideEffect` files — the MVI quintet.

## Testing

Unit tests cover ViewModels, mappers, and validation logic:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

Turbine is used for asserting Flow emissions; AssertK for readable failure messages.

## Status

This is an in-progress personal project. Public for learning, code review, and inspiration — not yet on the Play Store. Issues and suggestions welcome.
